								<p>I've finished my internship at Smart Knower in artificial intelligence. I finished their AI course at this time and turned in both a Minor Project and a Major Project.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Minor Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\AI Minor February_page-0001.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Objectives :</p>
									The objectives of this project are as follows:</p>	
								<p>1. To experiment with different classification methods to see
									which yields the highest accuracy</p>
							    <p>	2. To determine which features are the most indicative of a good
									quality wine</p>
								<p>Setup :</p>
								<p>First, I imported all of the relevant libraries that I’ll be using as well as
									the data itself.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (45).png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (46).png" alt="" /></span>
									<p> This is a very beginner-friendly dataset. I did not have to deal with any
										missing values, and there isn’t much flexibility to conduct some feature
										engineering given these variables. Next, I wanted to explore my data a
										little bit more.</p>
										<p>Exploring Variables :</p>

											<p>Histogram of ‘quality’ variable :</p>
											
										<p>	First, I wanted to see the distribution of the quality variable. I wanted
											to make sure that I had enough ‘good quality’ wines in my dataset —
											you’ll see later how I defined ‘good quality’.</p>	
											<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (47).png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Correlation Matrix :</p>
											<p>Next I wanted to see the correlations between the variables that I’m
												working with. This allows me to get a much better understanding of the
												relationships between my variables in a quick glimpse.</p>
												<p>Immediately, I can see that there are some variables that are strongly
													correlated to quality. It’s likely that these variables are also the most
													important features in our machine learning model, but we’ll take a look
													at that later.</p>
													<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (49).png" alt="" /></span>
													<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (48).png" alt="" /></span>

														miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life
														lessons, and more.</p>
														<p>Convert to a Classification Problem :</p>
														<p>Going back to my objective, I wanted to compare the effectiveness of
															different classification techniques, so I needed to change the output
															variable to a binary output.</p>
								<p>For this problem, I defined a bottle of wine as ‘good quality’ if it had a
									quality score of 7 or higher, and if it had a score of less than 7, it was
									deemed ‘bad quality’.</p>		
								<p>Once I converted the output variable to a binary output, I separated my
									feature variables (X) and the target variable (y) into separate
									dataframes.</p>	
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (51).png" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>Proportion of Good vs Bad Wines :</p>
								<p>I wanted to make sure that there was a reasonable number of good
									quality wines. Based on the results below, it seemed like a fair enough
									number. In some applications, resampling may be required if the data
									was extremely imbalanced, but I assumed that it was okay for this
									purpose.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (11).png" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>Preparing Data for Modelling :</p>
								<p>Standardizing Feature Variables</p>
								<p>At this point, I felt that I was ready to prepare the data for modelling.
									The first thing that I did was standardize the data. Standardizing the
									
									data means that it will transform the data so that its distribution will
									have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It’s important to
									standardize your data in order to equalize the range of the data.</p>
								<p>For example, imagine a dataset with two input features: height in
									millimeters and weight in pounds. Because the values of ‘height’ are
									much higher due to its measurement, a greater emphasis will
									automatically be placed on height than weight, creating a bias.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (52).png" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>Split data :</p>
								<p>Next I split the data into a training and test set so that I could cross-
									validate my models and determine their effectiveness.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (54).png" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>Modelling :</p>

								<p>Random Forest :</p>
								<p>Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of
									decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees
									using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly
									selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The
									model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision
									tree. What’s the point of this? By relying on a “majority wins” model, it
									reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.</p>	
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (56).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would
									predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the
									predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.</p>	
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (57).png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (58).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Random Forest :</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (60).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Comparing the Top 4 Features :</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (62).png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (63).png" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>By looking into the details, we can see that good quality wines have
									higher levels of alcohol on average, have a lower volatile acidity on
									average, higher levels of sulphates on average, and higher levels of
									residual sugar on average.</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Major Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\AI Major February_page-0001.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. With this, I'll be able to understand more about this field and create my own program that fits the data that I have. This particular classification problem can be useful for Gesture Navigation, for example. The method I'll be using is Deep Learning.</p>
								<p>Loading Data :</p>
								<p>This project uses the Hand Gesture Recognition Database (citation below) available on Kaggle. It contains 20000 images with different hands and hand gestures. There is a total of 10 hand gestures of 10 different people presented in the data set. There are 5 female subjects and 5 male subjects.
									The images were captured using the Leap Motion hand tracking device.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\1_frB0zTmnGUsZ8SzWOqV3sg.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>With that, we have to prepare the images to train the algorithm. We have to load all the images into an array that we will call X and all the labels into another array called y.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (65).png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Scipy’s train_test_split allows us to split our data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to build our model. Then, the test data will be used to check if our predictions are correct. A random_state seed is used so the randomness of our results can be reproduced. The function will shuffle the images it’s using to minimize training loss.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (67).png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>Creating Model :</p>
								<p>To simplify the idea of the model being constructed here, we’re going to use the concept of Linear Regression. By using linear regression, we can create a simple model and represent it using the equation y = ax + b.
									a and b (slope and intercept, respectively) are the parameters that we’re trying to find. By finding the best parameters, for any given value of x, we can predict y. This is the same idea here, but much more complex, with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks.</p>
									
								<p>A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, CNNs have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\1_nX6L9rclTnx0Hph5i01wzg.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>From above figure and imagining the Linear Regression model equation that we talked about, we can imagine that the input layer is x and the output layer is y. The hidden layers vary from model to model, but they are used to “learn” the parameters for our model. Each one has a different function, but they work towards getting the best “slope and intercept”.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (68).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>CNNs apply a series of filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, which the model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:</p>

									<p>Convolutional layers, which apply a specified number of convolution filters to the image. For each subregion, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. Convolutional layers then typically apply a ReLU activation function to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.</p>
									<P>Pooling layers, which downsample the image data extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.</P>
									<p>Dense (fully connected) layers, which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.</p>
									<p>Testing Model :</p>
									<p>Now that we have the model compiled and trained, we need to check if it’s good. First, we run ‘model.evaluate’ to test the accuracy. Then, we make predictions and plot the images as long with the predicted labels and true labels to check everything. With that, we can see how our algorithm is working.
									Later, we produce a confusion matrix, which is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (70).png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Conclusion :</p>
									<p>	Based on the results presented in the previous section, we can conclude that our algorithm successfully classifies different hand gestures images with enough confidence (>95%) based on a Deep Learning model.</p>
										
									<p>The accuracy of our model is directly influenced by a few aspects of our problem. The gestures presented are reasonably distinct, the images are clear and without background. Also, there is a reasonable quantity of images, which makes our model more robust. The drawback is that for different problems, we would probably need more data to stir the parameters of our model into a better direction. Moreover, a deep learning model is very hard to interpret, given it’s abstractions.</p>
